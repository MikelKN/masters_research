  \n6082   Hadn't really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store. so i tried it on. i'm only 5'1 and 140 lb. busty on top so i tried the 8. it was a smidge snug, decided since the dress has no give to go with a 10. would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length, but it's back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation. its just above my ankles in regular length, which will work and i can up the score with some wedges. this dress fits like a dream and   \n23410                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips.   \n13871                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is very cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. i'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok   \n5157       I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3\", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.   \n2008                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!

So often I think the shirt I sent or the gloves or scarves got filed away without enthusiasm even though I always received a grateful note.

She loved it. What can one say? If an 8 y/o loves it, it has to be good.   \n123357                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Lipton has been my tea of choice for many years.  I drink it English style, with milk & sugar.  In my experience, Lipton's is the only brand that holds it fabulous flavor after adding the accoutrements.  Great price and nice to have a subscription so I never run out.   \n293644                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Calm has lived up to its name.  In fact it has also helped my son with his muscle twitches.  I highly recommend trying it for anxiety and muscle issues.  And by purchasing it online I saved almost a huge amount of money!   \n321562                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We put walnuts in our cereal, and I used these in place of pine nuts in Pesto.

Eric D., Wanamingo, MN   \n150880  I drink quite a bit of green tea, and found the flavor of Higgins & Burke Green Tea to be very pleasant and different from others I have tried. The flavors were just strong enough, but not too strong. It didn't need any sweeteners added to create a pleasant drink. I did have trouble picking up on the lemon flavors. It is either very subtle or my palate is just not sensitive enough. I've had many green teas taste almost fishy and this was not the case with Higgins & Burke thankfully.

Wow is all I can say.  It has a great taste and gives me  a long term energy boost.  I have lost 60 pounds so far from exercising and fuel in a bottle gives me the energy to exercise daily. I was 329 pounds and now am 268 with clothes on.  100 pounds to go.  With fuel in an bottle I am confident I will have the weight off by March 2013.  Whooooo!

My favorites are the low acidity options.  Cucumber is my favorite.  Very refreshing, and a great alternative to soda.   \n60404   I've never used any Shake n Bake product so I didn't know what to expect. The instructions said to use 4 pork chops about 1 1/2\" thick and to cook at 425 degrees for 15 minutes or until done.  The instructions didn't tell whether to cover the pork or leave it uncovered.  I chose to leave them uncovered for about 20 minutes and when I saw that the pork chops weren't yet done I decided to cover with a sheet of foil to keep the heat in better.

When I purchased a small box of this  extra bold coffee, he said it was the best coffee he has ever had...home or in a restaurant!  I purchased this larger box, and he said, \"Why don't we put the Keurig in the kitchen, and put our 12 cup coffee maker away\"!  He is now having less cups of coffee...enjoying it much more...and absolutely no waste!   \n329904                                                                                                                                I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other brand/ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name/store brand cookies, so I have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days :(   \n228118                                                                               It's not Yuban, but it's not bad.  It's also not the Maxwell House that became famous as the watery church basement coffee of days gone by.<br /><br />It's got a robust flavor that surprised me, and no after taste to ruin it.<br /><br />Better than average brew for a rock bottom price.<br /><br />It's just what American needs right now--a decent cup of coffee that's not a budget-buster.<br /><br />Bravo, Maxwell House.   \n\n        ratings Originally  \n216318        3       Food  \n112891        3       Food  \n167945        3       Food  \n352124        3       Food  \n147888        3       Food  \n123357        3       Food  \n293644        3       Food  \n321562        3       Food  \n241231        3       Food  \n150880        3       Food  \n91135         3       Food  \n346310        3       Food  \n331230        3       Food  \n450112        3       Food  \n60404         3       Food  \n84569         3       Food  \n452232        3       Food  \n76571         3       Food  \n329904        3       Food  \n228118        3       Food  ","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Text</th>\n      <th>ratings</th>\n      <th>Originally</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>216318</th>\n      <td>I highly recommend this tea.

The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.<br /><br />It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show proba...   \n2  Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times).
